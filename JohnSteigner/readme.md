1. Choose a role for your capstone
   1. DA Data Analyst
   1. AAD Analytic Application Developer
1. Find an initial dataset you want to use for Capstone
   NUFORC UFO sightings 1947-2021 (Approx 100,000)
1. List first idea of goals for Capstone
   A current problem exists where such data is not organized in a meaningful way where researches can easily organize sightings by various types/characteristics so as to more-easily ascertain trends such as frequency of sightings in relative locations, patterns in physical characteristics of observed craft, impressions of witnesses, as well as identifying hoaxes easier to weed them out of the overall dataset. My goal is to provide an interactive and intuitive data experience for researchers who would like to visually, and easily, broaden their understanding of historical ufo/uap reporting.
